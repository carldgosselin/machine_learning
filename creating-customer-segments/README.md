### P3: Creating customer segments with unsupervised learning techniques

**Project Overview**

In this project,  I applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. I explored the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determined if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I preprocessed the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, I applied PCA transformations to the data and implemented clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I compared the segmentation found with an additional labeling and considered ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

**Things I learned by completing this project:**

* How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
* How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
* How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
* How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
* How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.

### Software and Library Requirements

This project requires the following software and libraries:

* Python 2.7
